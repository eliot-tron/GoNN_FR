# The Geometry of Neural Networks: a Riemannian Foliation Perspective on Robustness (GoNN:FR).

This package was developed as part of Eliot Tron's PhD thesis, under the supervision of Nicolas Couëllan, Rita Fioresi and Stéphane Puechmorel.
It implements the basic blocks of the framework described in the manuscript (soon) available online [here](https://theses.fr/s354611).

## Installation

Install GoNN_FR with pip:

```bash
  python -m pip install git+https://codeberg.org/eliot-tron/GoNN_FR
```
    
## Usage/Examples

More examples can be found in `./examples/`.

```python
import geometry from GoNN_FR
```
